## 🔹 **What is Bubble Sort?**

**Bubble Sort** is one of the simplest sorting algorithms.
It works like this:

* Compare **adjacent elements**.
* Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
* Repeat this process until the list is sorted.

🔑 **Key Idea:**
After the first pass, the **largest element “bubbles up” to the end**.
After the second pass, the second-largest element is at the second-last position, and so on.

---

## 🔹 **Simple Example Code**

Here’s the **easiest way** to write Bubble Sort in Python:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):  # Number of passes
        for j in range(n - i - 1):  # Compare adjacent elements
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:  # Swap if in wrong order
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]
print("Original List:", numbers)
print("Sorted List:", bubble_sort(numbers))
```

✅ **Output:**

```
Original List: [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]
Sorted List: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

---

No worries, Priya! 💡
Let’s break this **bubble sort code** down step by step so you understand **what each loop is doing**.


## 🔹 **Explanation of Loops**

### ✅ **Outer Loop → `for i in range(n):`**

This loop decides **how many passes** we make through the list.
We need to do `n` passes because after every pass, the biggest element “bubbles” to the end.

For example, if `n = 5` (5 elements),

* **Pass 1** → biggest element is at last position
* **Pass 2** → 2nd biggest element is at 2nd last
* ... until all sorted

---

### ✅ **Inner Loop → `for j in range(n - i - 1):`**

This loop **compares adjacent elements** and swaps them if they are in wrong order.
Notice `n - i - 1`:

* After every pass, last `i` elements are already sorted, so we don't need to compare them again.
  This **reduces unnecessary comparisons** and makes sorting faster.

---

## 🔹 **Dry Run Example**

Take `numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]`

| Pass (i)       | Comparisons (j)                                                                                                                                    | Swaps Done | Result After Pass                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| i=0 (1st pass) | Compare (5,2) → swap → \[2,5,8,1,3] <br> Compare (5,8) → no swap <br> Compare (8,1) → swap → \[2,5,1,8,3] <br> Compare (8,3) → swap → \[2,5,1,3,8] | 3 swaps    | Biggest element (8) moved to last |
| i=1 (2nd pass) | Compare (2,5) → no swap <br> Compare (5,1) → swap → \[2,1,5,3,8] <br> Compare (5,3) → swap → \[2,1,3,5,8]                                          | 2 swaps    | 2nd biggest (5) is now 2nd last   |
| i=2 (3rd pass) | Compare (2,1) → swap → \[1,2,3,5,8] <br> Compare (2,3) → no swap                                                                                   | 1 swap     | Now first 3 elements sorted       |
| i=3 (4th pass) | Compare (1,2) → no swap                                                                                                                            | 0 swaps    | Already sorted                    |

✅ **Final Sorted List:** `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`

---

### 🔑 **Takeaway**

* **Outer loop** → Number of passes needed (how many times we go through the list).
* **Inner loop** → Compare & swap adjacent elements for current pass.
* After each pass, **largest element moves to end**.

---

Would you like me to rewrite this code **without function and with print statements inside the loops** so you can see exactly what happens in each pass (live step-by-step)? That will make it super easy to follow.



## 🔹 **Practice Programs on Bubble Sort**

### ✅ 1. Sort in **Descending Order**

```python
def bubble_sort_desc(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] < arr[j + 1]:  # Change condition for descending
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr

numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]
print("Descending Order:", bubble_sort_desc(numbers))
```

---

### ✅ 2. Sort a **List of Strings**

```python
def bubble_sort_strings(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:  # Alphabetical order
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr

words = ["banana", "apple", "cherry", "mango"]
print("Sorted Words:", bubble_sort_strings(words))
```

---

### ✅ 3. Sort **Even and Odd Numbers Separately**

(Evens first, then odds, both in ascending order)

```
def bubble_sort_even_odd(arr):
    arr.sort()  # Simple sort first
    evens = [x for x in arr if x % 2 == 0]
    odds = [x for x in arr if x % 2 != 0]
    return evens + odds

numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3, 4]
print("Even then Odd:", bubble_sort_even_odd(numbers))
```


Perfect, Priya! 🌟 Let’s learn **Selection Sort** step by step — with clear explanation, simple code, and practice programs.

---

## 🔹 **What is Selection Sort?**

**Selection Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that works like this:

1. Find the **smallest element** in the list.
2. Swap it with the **first element**.
3. Then find the **next smallest** and swap with the **second element**.
4. Repeat until the whole list is sorted.

💡 **Key Idea:** We keep "selecting" the smallest element and putting it at the correct position — that's why it’s called **Selection Sort**.

---

## 🔹 **Simple Example Code**

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):  # Move through each position
        min_index = i   # Assume current i is smallest
        for j in range(i+1, n):  # Find smallest in remaining list
            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
                min_index = j
        # Swap smallest with element at i
        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]
    return arr

numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]
print("Original List:", numbers)
print("Sorted List:", selection_sort(numbers))
```

✅ **Output:**

```
Original List: [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]
Sorted List: [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

---

## 🔹 **Dry Run Example**

Take `[5, 2, 8, 1, 3]`

| Pass | i | min\_index found     | After Swap                    |
| ---- | - | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| 1    | 0 | 3 (value 1)          | `[1, 2, 8, 5, 3]`             |
| 2    | 1 | 1 (value 2)          | `[1, 2, 8, 5, 3]` (no change) |
| 3    | 2 | 4 (value 3)          | `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`             |
| 4    | 3 | 3 (value 5)          | `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]`             |
| 5    | 4 | Already last element | `[1, 2, 3, 5, 8]` ✅           |

---

## 🔹 **Programs for Practice**

### ✅ 1. Selection Sort Without Function

```
arr = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]
n = len(arr)

print("Original List:", arr)

for i in range(n):
    min_index = i
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:
            min_index = j
    arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]

print("Sorted List:", arr)
```

---

### ✅ 2. Selection Sort in Descending Order

```
def selection_sort_desc(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        max_index = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            if arr[j] > arr[max_index]:
                max_index = j
        arr[i], arr[max_index] = arr[max_index], arr[i]
    return arr

numbers = [5, 2, 8, 1, 3]
print("Descending Order:", selection_sort_desc(numbers))
```

---

### ✅ 3. Selection Sort on Strings

```
words = ["banana", "apple", "cherry", "mango"]
n = len(words)

for i in range(n):
    min_index = i
    for j in range(i+1, n):
        if words[j] < words[min_index]:  # Alphabetical order
            min_index = j
    words[i], words[min_index] = words[min_index], words[i]

print("Sorted Words:", words)
```


## 🔑 **When to Use Selection Sort**

* ✅ Easy to implement, good for **small lists**
* ❌ Not efficient for large datasets (O(n²) complexity)

---

Would you like me to write **selection sort with print statements inside the loop** (to show which element is chosen as minimum in each pass)? This will help you clearly see how elements are selected and swapped.


## 🧩 **3. Merge Sort (Step-by-Step)**

Got it! ✅
You want a **clean and simple Merge Sort code** (just like the snippet you wrote), with no extra prints — just the sorting logic.

Here’s the **exact code** in that style:

---

### 🧩 **Merge Sort (Simple & Clean Code)**

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])

    # Merge step
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1

    # Add remaining elements
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result

# Example usage
arr = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
print("Original array:", arr)
print("Sorted array:", merge_sort(arr))
```

---

### ✅ **Output**

```
Original array: [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
Sorted array: [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]
```


## ⚡ **4. Quick Sort (Step-by-Step)**

```
def quick_sort(arr, depth=0):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr)//2]
    print("  " * depth + f"Pivot chosen: {pivot}")
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    print("  " * depth + f"Left: {left}, Middle: {middle}, Right: {right}")
    return quick_sort(left, depth+1) + middle + quick_sort(right, depth+1)

arr = [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]
print("Original array:", arr)
print("Sorted array:", quick_sort(arr))
```

---

### ✅ **These Codes Are:**

* **Easy to Read** (Beginner-friendly)
* **Step-by-Step Explained** (Prints after every important step)
* **Understandable** (Shows how array changes at each pass)

Absolutely! 🙌
Let’s go through **Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort** one by one —
I’ll give you **clear matter + simple explanation + easy points to remember**.

---

# 🫧 **1. Bubble Sort**

### 📖 **Matter:**

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
After each pass, the largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position at the end.

---

### 🧠 **Explanation (Easy):**

1. Compare `arr[0]` with `arr[1]`.
   If `arr[0] > arr[1]`, swap them.
2. Move to `arr[1]` and `arr[2]`, compare and swap if needed.
3. Keep going until the last pair.
4. After first pass, the largest element is at the last position.
5. Repeat the process for remaining elements until the array is sorted.

---

### 🔑 **Key Points:**

* Works by swapping neighbors until sorted.
* **Time Complexity:**

  * Worst case: O(n²)
  * Best case: O(n) (if already sorted)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) (no extra space needed)
* **Easy to understand but slow** for large data.

---

---

# 🏆 **2. Selection Sort**

### 📖 **Matter:**

Selection Sort works by finding the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. It keeps selecting the minimum and placing it in order until the entire array is sorted.

---

### 🧠 **Explanation (Easy):**

1. Find the smallest element in the entire array.
2. Swap it with the first element.
3. Now, find the smallest element in the remaining array.
4. Swap it with the second element.
5. Continue until the whole array is sorted.

---

### 🔑 **Key Points:**

* Selects minimum and places it at correct position.
* **Time Complexity:** O(n²) (always compares even if sorted)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1)
* **Fewer swaps** than bubble sort but still slow for big data.

---

---

# 🧩 **3. Merge Sort**

### 📖 **Matter:**

Merge Sort is a **divide and conquer algorithm**.
It splits the array into two halves, sorts each half recursively, and then merges the two sorted halves.

---

### 🧠 **Explanation (Easy):**

1. Divide the array into two halves until single elements remain.
2. Merge two single elements into a sorted pair.
3. Merge sorted pairs into sorted groups.
4. Continue merging until the full array is combined in sorted order.

---

### 🔑 **Key Points:**

* **Divide and Conquer** approach.
* **Time Complexity:** O(n log n) (very efficient)
* **Space Complexity:** O(n) (uses extra space for merging)
* **Stable sorting algorithm** (keeps equal elements in order)
* **Good choice for large data**.

---

---

# ⚡ **4. Quick Sort**

### 📖 **Matter:**

Quick Sort is also a **divide and conquer algorithm**.
It chooses a **pivot** element, partitions the array into two sub-arrays (smaller than pivot and greater than pivot), and then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.

---

### 🧠 **Explanation (Easy):**

1. Choose a pivot (middle, first, last, or random element).
2. Put all elements smaller than pivot on left, larger on right.
3. Recursively sort left and right parts.
4. Combine to get fully sorted array.

---

### 🔑 **Key Points:**

* **Divide and Conquer** but faster in practice than merge sort (less memory).
* **Time Complexity:**

  * Average: O(n log n)
  * Worst case: O(n²) (if bad pivot chosen)
* **Space Complexity:** O(log n) (uses recursion stack)
* **Very efficient** for large data (most used in real life).

# 📝 **Quick Summary Table**

| Algorithm          | Working Style          | Time (Avg) | Space    | Best For                            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Bubble Sort**    | Swap adjacent elements | O(n²)      | O(1)     | Very small arrays, learning purpose |
| **Selection Sort** | Select min and swap    | O(n²)      | O(1)     | Small arrays, fewer swaps needed    |
| **Merge Sort**     | Divide & merge         | O(n log n) | O(n)     | Large arrays, stable sort           |
| **Quick Sort**     | Partition around pivot | O(n log n) | O(log n) | Large arrays, in-place fast sort    |
